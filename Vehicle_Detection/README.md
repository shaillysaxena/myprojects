# Vehicle_Detection
Goals of the project are as follows:
- Extract features from an image using HOG features, color transforms and binned color features.
- Train a linear SVM on these features to classify cars from non-cars.
- Implement a sliding-window technique and use this trained classifier to search for vehicles in the image.
- Run this pipeline on video stream and create a heat map of recurring detections frame by frame to reject outliers and follow detected vehicles.
- Estimate a bounding box for vehicles detected.
I have used vehicle and non-vehicle data provided by Udacity.
