# Experiments in Online Learning to compare Perceptron and Winnow performance on synthetic data

Created different kind of synthetic data and implemented Perceptron and Winnow from scratch.
Performed a number of experiments to study behavior and performance of both.
Code doesn't make use of ML libraries like scikit-learn.
